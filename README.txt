App for graph plots, the math function of the graph must be passed in the code, inside the function:

public double function(double x){
    return %MATH_FUNCTION%
}

You can zoom in and zoom out using the mouse scroll, move the plot dragging the mouse, and click in the points of the curve to see the values of x and y on that point.
